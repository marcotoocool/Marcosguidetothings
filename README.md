This isnt anything important but i hope this can be to some use for anyone in the future who might see this, but this is hopefully my begginer journey to something im attempting to learn java in a advanced way. But i like to journal alot so i will be adding things here i find helpful or that i want to remember i feel journaling is really really important so i like to just list things down so i can comeback to understand this. There might be some code included or there might be a ton of other things i will comeback every single day to get the motivation.


I feel its very important to not memorize things but to understand them i really think its important that you dont get frustrated and that it might take some time to learn things but thats okay
